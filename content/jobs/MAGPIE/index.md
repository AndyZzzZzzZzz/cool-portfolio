- Applied pairwise logistic regression to predict tuberculosis (TB) genetic cluster memberships using epidemiological data from 11,000 patients. Model published in [**Microbial Genomics** ](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.000929), 2023
- Performed cluster analysis using SNP cutoff thresholds, untimed maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree construction, and spatial data; applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
- Utilized R for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, and applied supervised learning models to benchmark quantitative predictions.
- Presented research findings monthly to the MAGPIE research group and delivered a seminar to SFU Math USRA students.
